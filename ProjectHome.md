Filcau is a card game played by two people or by two teams of people (two person in each team) with exactly 20 cards.

This project has in plan:
  * the creation of a game engine (playing rules) in pure Java
  * creating an Android version of the game (just GUI)
  * creating a Swing version of the game
  * build a web application were more users can log in and play in the same time (GWT will  most probably be used for the UI)
  * create some AI that can beat humans with more or less difficulty
